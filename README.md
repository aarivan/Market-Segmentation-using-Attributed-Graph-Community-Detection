# Market-Segmentation-using-Attributed-Graph-Community-Detection
Overview: Market segmentation divides a broad target market into subsets of consumers or businesses that have or are perceived to have common needs, interests, and priorities. These segments help firms or businesses focus on their target groups effectively and allocate resources efficiently. Traditional segmentation methods are solely based on attribute data such as demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, education, etc.) and psychographic profiles (lifestyle, personality, motives, etc.). However, social networks have recently become important for marketing. Depending on the nature of the market, social relations can even become vital in forming segments. Such social relations combined with demographic properties can be used to find more relevant subsets of consumers or businesses (i.e., communities).
